Clicking “Update database...” will replace the data stored by the Anvil app with whatever is in the spreadsheet above
*Caution: any database rows with the same Project Number will be overwritten.*

Clicking “Clear entire database…” will, well. You will be asked to tick a box to say you’re sure before doing this.
